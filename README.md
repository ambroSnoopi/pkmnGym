# Pokémon Gym Challange

A fanmade Pokémon game using Pokémon Essentials for RPG Maker XP. 

You will play a Gym Leader and defend your Badge against countless challenger. The challengers will be generated at random and will be powered by a competitive AI. Winning will increase your reputation and give you access to new state-governed Pokémon and benefits. Can you climb up the ladder to the very top of the Elite Four?

## About this Project

This is a hobby data science project for me to get familiar & apply Machine Learning and AI. Since I'm already putting so much effort in it, why not turn it into something others could enjoy?

## About this Repo

This Git Repository is only for managing the modifications to the Scripts for RPG Maker XP.

It will not contain all ressources needed to play the game.

### Contribute with Log Data

While I would certainly welcome anyone who's willing to help me with coding the game or with the ML bits and pieces, I'd be most grateful if you could contribute your Battle-Logs.

During battles, Logs will be written at the games root directory to: ML/logs/

These logs are used to train the AI. But since I don't have hours to play myself - and simulated battles don't really reflect human play styles - I am very much dependant on you players to help me gather the amount training data needed to develop a competitive AI.

If you wan't to contribute, please upload/committ your logs to this repo: [ML/logs]/<yourAlias>/

Thank you!

## How to Play the Game

The game is currently in closed alpha and not publicly available.

A compiled executable of the Game may be distributed once it has reached the beta phase.
